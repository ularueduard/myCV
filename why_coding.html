        <h3>Why do I want to learn Coding?</h3>
        <p>I decided to learn web development because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I want to change my carrer into something less conflictual</li>
            <li>I want to be more relaxed and more peacefull</li>
            <li>I hope by learning this I will be able to obtain my freedom financial and locative</li>
            <li>I want to simplify my life and live more in armony with myself</li>
            <li>I love creating new things</li>
            <li>Coding relaxes me and makes me feel in control</li>
            <li>This carrer offers infinit ways of improvment and development you can learn and create a lot of new thing that can help others</li>
            <li>Provide opportunities of creating revenew streams and obtaining enough amounts of money to do whatever you want</li>
            <li>I see it as a passion not as work, i could do this for hours without getting bored</li>
            <li>You have the possibility of meeting new and interesting people </li>
            <li>I believe that when i will become a good proffesional in this activity i can help more people with my work</li>
            <li>This activity is tangible you can see the outcome of your work and measure your succes and development</li>
            <li>It can be done independently or in teams and this gives me the freedom to choose how I will work in the future</li>
            <li>It is not as riskfull as my other jobs as an administrator and entrepreneur or like the ferry business</li>
            <li>I am very attracted to it since I was a small boy</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I hope to gain from this?</h3>
        <p>I hope that by learning this I will be able to have a calmer life, with less stress and with not so many risks, i hope that i will gain a sense of improvment <br>
        by measuring the difficulty of problems I will be able to fix.I hope to be able to choose if I want to continue to act as a creator of a team or just to remain a <br>
        member of one. I want to gain a more stable enviroment of working in one place and not beeing on the road all the time. To gain time to have more time for myself.<br>
        for creating a familly.I hope to find other people and to start having more fun at work and to play more, to leaf more and to find likeminded people. <br>
        I hope to work in better enviroments and be part of big projects that can serve a higher purpose and help a lot of people.
